# Unexpected Behavior with `calc()` in CSS Flexbox

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS, specifically within the context of flexbox layouts. The problem arises from the way `calc()` interacts with dynamic or implicitly sized elements within a flex container.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.css` provides a solution.

## Bug:
The `calc()` function is used to calculate the width of an element based on its parent's width. However, if the parent's width is not explicitly defined or is dependent on other dynamic factors (common in flexbox layouts), the `calc()` function may not produce the intended result. This can lead to unexpected layout behaviors such as the element not fitting its container or having unexpected margins/padding.

## Solution:
The solution involves ensuring the parent container has a defined width, or if that's not feasible, using a different approach to size the element.  Sometimes, restructuring the layout to avoid relying on the dynamic parent's size is the most efficient solution.
